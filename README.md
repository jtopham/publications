> *Nearly one in six patients with PDAC have tumors that fail to reliably fall into the classical or basal-like PDAC subtype categories, based on two regression tools aimed towards clinical practice. Rather, these patient tumors show intermediate prognostic and molecular traits. We propose close consideration of the non-binary nature of PDAC subtypes for future incorporation of subtyping into clinical practice.*

> *We performed bioinformatics analysis of genomic, transcriptomic and clinical data across an integrated cohort of 199 metastatic breast, colorectal and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patient tumors. Within each cancer type, we identified a subgroup of viral mimicry tumors in which increased ERV levels were coupled with transcriptional signatures of autonomous antiviral response and immunogenicity. In addition, viral mimicry colorectal and pancreatic tumors showed increased expression of DNA demethylation gene TET2. Taken together, these data demonstrate the existence of an ERV-associated viral mimicry phenotype across three distinct metastatic cancer types, while indicating links between ERV abundance, epigenetic dysregulation and immunogenicity.*

> *Our comprehensive analysis of sequencing data generated from a large cohort of PDAC patient samples highlights a distinctive pattern of bi-allelic CDKN2A mutation in EOPC tumors. Increased expression of FOXC2 in EOPC, with the correlation between FOXC2 and EMT pathways, represent novel molecular characteristics of EOPC.*

> *Exploratory baseline circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) sequencing revealed increased survival for patients with KRAS wildtype tumors in both the combination immunotherapy (p = 0.001) and chemotherapy (p = 0.004) groups. These data support the utility of ctDNA analysis in PDAC and the prognostic value of ctDNA-based KRAS mutation status.*

[Integrative analysis of KRAS wildtype metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma reveals mutation and expression-based similarities to cholangiocarcinoma](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36209277/)

> 
> *By leveraging data from colorectal adenocarcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma samples, we highlight similarities between cholangiocarcinoma and KRAS wildtype mPDAC involving both mutation and expression-based signatures and validate these findings using an independent dataset. These data further establish KRAS wildtype mPDAC as a unique molecular entity, with therapeutic opportunities extending beyond gene fusion events.*
