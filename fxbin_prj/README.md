## **Focal amplification and overexpression of E3 ubiquitin ligase genes CBLC and SMURF1 in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma** *(in submission)*

<br> This project utilized matched RNA and WG-sequencing for 69 patients with metastatic PDAC, enrolled as part of the [PanGen trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02869802). The genome was partitioned into non-overlapping 20 kb segments ('bins'). Copy number and RNA-seq coverage was assessed at each bin. Functional bins were defined as those having recurrent copy number amplification or deletion events and significantly altered RNA coverage. Results were validated in external PDAC datasets (both metastatic and resectable PDAC cohorts). Other cancer types were investigated by leveraging the full TCGA data cohort.
