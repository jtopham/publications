## **Neutrophil Extracellular Trap gene expression signatures identify prognostic and targetable signaling axes for inhibiting metastasis of pancreatic tumours** *(in submission)*

<br> This project identified novel NET-related gene expression signatures for PDAC patient stratification, and revealed targetable signaling axes to prevent and treat disease progression and metastasis. Data was analyzed from patient tumors sequenced as part of the PanGen (NCT02869802), POG (NCT02155621), ICGC, TCGA and CPTAC-3 projects/trials

The Makefile code used to process the data can be found [here](makefile_NET_prj)

The RScript used for data analysis can be found [here](rscript_NET_prj.R)
